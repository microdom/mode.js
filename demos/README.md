# Sortable (Multi-list + Touch)

This demo shows how Mode JS can be used to build
a fully functional sortable system with:

- multiple lists
- touch and pointer support
- empty container handling

The goal is not to provide a reusable sortable,
but to demonstrate how movement, intent, and structure
can be composed using Mode JS.
